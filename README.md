## Discord Notifications
Discord notifications are toggled on and off like every other type, but also require some additional configuration.

### Webhook Creation
On a discord server on which you are an admin: right click a text channel, select webhooks, create webhook, set name/icon as you wish, then copy the webhook url. Enter this as either the personal or clan discord webhook fields.

### User/Group
Direct user mentions and group mentions are both accepted. `@everyone` and `@here` work great. If you would like to notify individual users, you must use the format `<@UserId>` where UserId is the ID of the desired user (not username). Information on getting user IDs can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/61n0sj/pinging_rolesusers_linking_text_channels_through/dffsiuk/). Multiple user names can be specified, eg `<@FirstUserId> <@SecondUserId>`.

## Slack Notifications
Slack notifications are toggled on and off like every other type, but also require some additional configuration.

##Webhook Creation
On a slack server on which you can add apps: add the app incoming-webhooks and set the channel where the app will live. Copy the webhook url. Enter this in the Slack field.

##User/Group
Direct user mentions and group mentions are both accepted. '@channel' and '@here" both work. Any mention must be formatted as <!mention>, or <!channel> as an example. UserId's follow the same format. You can get the userId by typing @displayName of the user.

## Custom Sounds
Custom sounds must be hosted by a fileserver accessible to your browser. This can be an external website if you find a file hosted online.

### Locally Hosted Sounds
If you would like to host audio files from your computer, the Python HTTP Server can be very easy to set up. See [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#Running_a_simple_local_HTTP_server) for instructions on setting it up. Assuming you have the file `myaudiofile.wav` hosted locally on port 8000, enter `http://127.0.0.1:800/myaudiofile.wav` into the Sound File URL in NoA.

## TODOs/Vague Ideas
* Recurring notifications for
  * Fatigue
* Effect changes (double->triple, rage->fury, etc)
* Throttle notifications to prevent being spammed
* Come up with additional features
* Settings
  * Throttle timer
